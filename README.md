# SoilMoisture
I did this project back in September Last year
The goal was to obtain: AirHumid,Temp,Moisture data. Then this data will be fed to Raspberry Pi 3 to be modified into csv files.

Soil moisture sensor was using DHT22 moisture sensor which was resistive sensor. It was bad. My recommendation is to buy the capacitive one.
